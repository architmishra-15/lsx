# lsx

A Go rewrite of `ls` command present in many POSIX systems. Although it is still not as good as the original ofc. I will be working on it and would be adding other commands and flags whenever I could.

## Features

One of the main reasons and feature of this rewrite is the icon support in files. It'll show the icons along with the files.

## Requirements

- [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)
- A modern POSIX terminal like `iterm2`, `Alacritty`, `WezTerm`, `Kitty` or `Ghostty` etc.
